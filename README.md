Homework 1:

Implements Choleski Decomposition and applies it to solve simple circuit equations. 

Implements an algorithm to generate larger networks, takes advantage of sparsity to solve the networks and analyses their computation times. 

Implements finite differences method to find the potential at the nodes of a regular mesh in the air between the conductors.

Homework 2:

Finite elements method and its application to compute the electrostatic potential solutions.

Conjugate gradient method and its application to compute the electrostatic potential solutions.

Comparision of different methods (SOR, conjugate gradient, choleski and finite elements).

Homework 3:

Curve fitting and solution of non-linear equations.
